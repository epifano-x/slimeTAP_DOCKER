# SlimeTAP

SlimeTAP is a game developed as a web application based on Razor Pages. It is a fun pastime where each tap on the screen earns the player gold coins. These coins can be used to purchase upgrades for the tap, increasing the value earned per tap or the quantity of taps.

## Key Features

- **Coin Earning**: Each tap on the screen earns the player gold coins, which are the main currency in the game.
- **Tap Upgrades**: The player can invest gold coins in upgrades to improve the value earned per tap or increase the quantity of taps performed.
- **Missions**: The game offers missions that the player can complete to earn experience (XP) and two other in-game currencies.
- **Lootboxes and Equipment**: In addition to gold coins, the player can use the other two currencies acquired through missions to purchase lootboxes and equipment, which provide additional benefits.
